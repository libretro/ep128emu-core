# ep128emu-core config file sample.
# Should be next to the content and have the same basename as the content file itself
# Examples:
#   Sorcery.tap -> Sorcery.ep128cfg
#   Catacomb (1985)(Enterprise Computers).com -> Catacomb (1985)(Enterprise Computers).ep128cfg
# A configuration file can also be put to <retroarch system directory>/ep128emu/config,
# for each emulated system. using these names:
#   enterprise.ep128cfg
#   tvc.ep128cfg
#   cpc.ep128cfg
#   zx.ep128cfg
# Priority of setting, lowest to highest:
#   ep128emu-core hardcoded defaults
#   system-wide configuration file
#   content specific configuration file
#   core options set in RetroArch GUI (if not set to default)

# Joypad direction and fire mapping. Can be empty, which means machine-dependent default:
# EP:  user1 internal, user2..user6 ext1..ext5
# CPC: user1 ext1, user2 ext2
# TVC: user1 internal, user2..3 ext1..2
# ZX:  user1 ext1 (Kempston), user2 Sinclair1, user3 Sinclair2, user4 Protek

# Or one of:
#   INTERNAL (internal joystick of EP and TVC)
#   EXT1, EXT2 (external joysticks for EP, TVC, CPC, EXT1 is Kempston for ZX)
#   SINCLAIR1, SINCLAIR2, PROTEK (adapters for ZX Spectrum)
#   EXT3, EXT4, EXT5, EXT6 (additional external joysticks for EP, very rarely used)
# Use the quotes, i.e.
# joypad.user1 "EXT1"

# Joypad detailed configuration for user 1. Example:
# joypad.x "1"
# This maps retropad button X to pressing key 1 on emulated keyboard.
# Following keypress values can be used (all lowercase):
#   a-z 0-9 f1-f8
#   \-^;:[],/.@
#   esc, enter, space, tab, lshift, rshift, ctrl, alt
#   lock, stop, hold, erase, del, ins
# Internal joystick (EP/TVC), cursor keys (CPC):
#   left, right, up, down
# External joysticks:
#   joy1l, joy1r, joy1u, joy1d, fire,  fire2,  fire3  (external 1 joystick)
#   joy2l, joy2r, joy2u, joy2d, joy2f, joy2f2, joy2f3 (external 2 joystick)
#   Fire 1 is used. Fire 2 is used only by some CPC games.
#   Similar mapping exists for external joysticks 3..6 (EP only)
# CPC extra key mapping: 
#   F0 is pause, F9 is stop, Copy is ins, F Dot is alt,
#   Clear is del, Delete is erase, Enter is rshift
# TVC extra key mapping:
#   o: is @ , i' is esc, @ is f1, ; is f2, <> is f3, \ is f4,
#   * is f5, ^ is f6, [ is f7, ] is f8, esc is stop
# Special ep128emu-core functions:
#   zoom, info, none ("none" removes the core default setting)

# Emulated machine type. Normally autodetected from content. Can be one of the following:

#   EP128_DISK, EP128_TAPE, EP128_TAPE_NOCART, EP128_FILE, EP128_FILE_DTF, EP128_DISK_ISDOS

# CPC (6128 unless noted):

# ZX:
#   ZX16_TAPE, ZX16_FILE, ZX48_TAPE, ZX48_FILE, ZX128_TAPE, ZX128_FILE
# Variants with _DISK are for disk images, _TAPE for tape images
# _FILE can be used for direct file reading (.cas for TVC, .tap for ZX, ,com/.bas/other extensions for EP)
# _FILE_DTF is for DTF compressed files, _NOCART removes Basic cartridge
# _DISK_ISDOS is for CP/M
